I have liked computer games as I remeber, but I don't have time and mood for playing them these days. It's coming in waves. I found some game, playing it for a few weeks and then I am going to have fun with something else. Maybe you know it. Last two or three years I played for example Dishonored, WatchDogs, Factorio, Cities: Skylines, Starbound and maybe some others. But if you like games like me and don't have time like me, you will probably be comfortable even with gameplay on YouTube.

Yeah I know, it's for childern, but let me show you one guy, who treat the game as a chess. He calls himself Zemalf and he has YouTube channel with RPG and stragery gameplays. He was silent for a few months but now he came with a new seasson of XCOM 2 Legend Ironman. Have you played the new X-Com? If your answer is yes than you know there is
